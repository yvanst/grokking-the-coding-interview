//! Given an array of numbers sorted in an ascending order, find the ceiling of a given number key.
//! The ceiling of the key will be the smallest element in the given array greater than or equal to
//! the key.
//!
//! Write a function to return the index of the ceiling of the key. If there isnâ€™t any ceiling
//! return -1.

/// this problem follows the Binary Search pattern. since binary search helps us find a number in a
/// sorted array efficiently, we can use a modified version of the binary search to find the ceiling
/// of a number
///
/// we will try to search for the key in the given array. if we find the key, we return its index as
/// the ceiling. if we can't find the key, the next big number will be pointed out by the index start
///
/// because (low+high)/2 is round toward low, so eventually mid will point to low when high-low=1,
/// in that case, we will move low beyond target in the next loop, and the mid will be the same
/// value as low and high which will be larger than the target, in the next round, high will move
/// left by 1 to break the low<=high condition
