//! in many problems, where we are given a set of elements such that we can divide them into two
//! parts. to solve the problem, we are interested in knowing the smallest element in one part and
//! the biggest element in the other part. this pattern is an efficient approach to solve such
//! problems.
//
//! this patterns uses two Heaps to solve these problems; a Min Heap to find the smallest element
//! and a Max Heap to find the biggest element.
