/// To complete the implementation, we need to implement the partitioning method. We use the
/// following general strategy:
/// - First, we arbitrarily choose a[lo] to be the partitioning itemâ€”the one that will go into its
/// final position.
/// - Next, we scan from the left end of the array until we find an entry that is greater than (or
/// equal to) the partitioning item, and we scan from the right end of the array until we find an
/// entry less than (or equal to) the partitioning item.
/// - The two items that stopped the scans are out of place in the final partitioned array, so we
/// exchange them.
/// - When the scan indices cross, all that we need to do to complete the partitioning process is to
/// exchange the partitioning item a[lo] with the rightmost entry of the left subarray (a[j]) and
/// return its index j.
